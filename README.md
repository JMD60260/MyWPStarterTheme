## Usage

All you need to edit is in `_src/` folder.

### Commandes

#### `npx gulp`

When developing, use browser sync to speed up your productivity.
It'll compile the scss, prefixes it, quickly optimize images, minify scripts and copy PHP files to the good folder.

#### `npxgulp build`

Optimize your project before upload it !
It'll compile the scss, prefixes it, better optimize images (with an acceptable lossy compression), minify scripts and copy PHP files to the good folder.

#### `npx gulp clean`

For any reason you what to clean-up the project by delete build files.
It will clear caching and delete all build files to just keep essential files and sources.

> I prefer to use package locally so I use `npx` to execute gulp. If you prefer to call gulp directly, install it globally : `npm i -g gulp`
